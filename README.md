# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

# ðŸ“š BookBot

**BookBot** is a simple Python program that analyzes text files of books and reports:
- Total number of words
- Frequency of each character (case-insensitive)

This is great for analyzing public domain books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
